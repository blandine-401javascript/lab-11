- Stack

  - push() - A function that takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack
  - pop() - A function that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value 
  - peek() - A function that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack.
  - isEmpty() - A function that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

- Queue

  - enqueue() - A function that takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue
  - dequeue() - A function that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value & should raise exception when called on empty queue.
